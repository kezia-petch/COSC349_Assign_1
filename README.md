# COSC349 Assignment 1:

Multi VM project focused on providing the user with the date and time of specific countries.

## Running the Project:

Clone the COSC349_Assign_1 repository, using HTTPS, found when pressing the "Clone" button above. Users will then need to clone the repository into their home directory, in order to actually access the project. This cloning process can be completed in the command line, in terminal, using the command; 

git clone [The HTTPS link provided when the user cloned the repository]

Users will then need to navigate to the COSC_Assign_1 folder that the previous command would have created in your home directory. Then run the command, in terminal;

vagrant up --provider virtualbox

The user should then navigate to the webpage; https://localhost:8090 to view the project in action.
